I use the bootstrap frame to create a three pages website for a fictional dessert shop "Sweet Home".

The first challenge is I'm not sure how to use the bootstrap to create a link which will link to other page so I check the file responsive-nav from last term after that I believe I need create multiple html with have bootstrap frame then I check the navbar and navbar-collapse components in "getbootstrap.com" after that I figure I need put the nav link into those components and set the navbar in each page.

There are one more challenge I met is I don't know how to make the iframe map become responsive in my bootstrap web. When I search the "get bootstrap.com" I found a utilitie called Embed It can put a video in the web page also make the video screen responsively and in that example it also use the iframe tag for import video. So I try to replace the "src" from video link to google map link and it is work.
